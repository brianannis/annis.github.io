As a Desktop Analyst at J.Crew, I overhauled the existing MDT environment, resulting in a 5x decrease in deployment time per node (4.5 hours to 45 minutes), saving 2,700 man-hours and $162,000 annually. I also successfully automated the installation and provisioning of over a dozen business applications and added inline patching to the imaging process.
